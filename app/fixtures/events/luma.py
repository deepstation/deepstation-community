​Session Title: "The AI + Automation Advantage: A Simpler Way to Build Your Digital Workforce"

​Speaker:

​👤 Monique Salomon, Founder & AI Educator, AlmaOperations.AI

​Description:

​💡 What if you could hire a team of smart, fast digital employees — without payroll, burnout, or overwhelm?

​In this fast, actionable demo, Monique Salomon reveals the true powerhouse hiding in your business: the partnership between custom GPTs (your thinkers) and automations (your doers).

​Whether you’re non-technical or tech-savvy but looking for faster wins, this approach gives you a simple, practical foundation to start scaling smarter — without heavy coding, steep learning curves, or complex setups.

​You’ll discover how to combine smart thinking and fast execution into real systems that help you move faster, close more opportunities, and continue building business momentum — starting today.

​Session Title: "Prompt Engineering Best Practices: Business Automation Edition"

Speaker:

​👤 Grant Kurz, Founder, GPTuesdays

​Description:

​Using AI in your business workflow has the ability to super-charge your productivity and save you several hours of work every single week. Many people use ChatGPT daily, but are only touching the surface of what is possible. Imagine if you could leverage AI to produce consistent high-quality content with SEO optimization, automate social media posts, or handle customer inquiries with conversational AI while protecting against known risks such as jailbreaking or an AI agent giving the wrong price to your customers?

​Grant Kurz has created AI call centers for clients, automated factories such as Coca-Cola during his time at SYSCON International, and has learned from hundreds of cutting-edge and innovative AI presentations through GPTuesdays. Now, he will share some of what he has learned, with you.

Title: "How to Use LLM Techniques: RAG, Guardrails and MoE"

Description:
💡 Join us for a fast-paced workshop that demystifies three of today's most practical large-language-model techniques---Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Guardrails, and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Through bite‑sized lectures and live coding demos, you'll learn how to fuse vector search with LLMs to ground answers in your own data, wrap models in robust policy and schema constraints to tame hallucinations, and tap sparse‑routing MoE architectures to boost performance without breaking the compute budget.

Whether you're a developer looking to productionize chatbots, an architect evaluating scaling strategies, or simply curious about the nuts and bolts behind cutting-edge AI, you'll leave with reusable notebooks, a starter repo, and a clear mental model of when---and when not---to wield these tools.
