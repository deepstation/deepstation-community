GPTechday: Miami’s Leading AI Community

In the heart of Miami’s thriving tech ecosystem, GPTechday stands as the city's longest-running and most vibrant AI community. More than just a weekly meetup, GPTechday brings together engineers, researchers, entrepreneurs, and enthusiasts to foster collaboration, build innovative solutions, and grow together in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence.

How It Started

Launched on June 6th, 2023, GPTechday began with a small group of passionate AI professionals. From intimate gatherings of 10–20 people, the community has grown to attract over 100–150 attendees every Tuesday. This rapid growth reflects a strong regional demand for collaborative learning and open knowledge-sharing in AI.

Our Mission and Vision

GPTechday exists to accelerate AI education and innovation for humanity through the power of community. We do this by fostering collaboration between developers, researchers, and industry leaders, hosting high-impact events, providing intensive learning experiences, and supporting promising AI projects through funding and investment initiatives.

What We Offer

GPTechday operates through four main pillars:

Open Innovation – Facilitating collaboration and knowledge exchange

Summits – Hosting large-scale, high-impact gatherings of AI professionals

Workshops – Delivering hands-on technical sessions led by experts

Funding Initiatives – Supporting early-stage AI projects through grants and investment programs
